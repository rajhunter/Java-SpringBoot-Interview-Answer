**Basic Java Multithreading Questions**

1.  **What is a thread in Java?**\
    A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of
    processing. Java allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of
    a program using threads.

2.  **How do you create a thread in Java?**

    - By **extending Thread** class and overriding run() method.

    - By **implementing Runnable** interface and passing it to a Thread
      object.

>
> public void run() {
>
> System.out.println(\"Thread running\...\");
>
> }
>
> }
>
> new Thread(new MyRunnable()).start();

3.  **Difference between start() and run() method?**

    - start(): Creates a new thread and executes run() in it.

    - run(): Executes in the current thread like a normal method.

**ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Questions**

4.  **What is the difference between Runnable and Callable?**

    - Runnable does not return a result or throw checked exceptions.

    - Callable (Java 5+) returns a result and can throw checked
      exceptions.

    - Used with ExecutorService.

5.  **How does synchronization work in Java?**

    - Used to avoid thread interference and memory consistency errors.

    - Synchronized methods or blocks allow only one thread to access the
      resource.

>
> synchronized void update() {
>
> // only one thread can enter here at a time
>
> }

6.  **What is a deadlock? How do you avoid it?**

    - A situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting
      for each other.\
      **Avoid by:**

    - Lock ordering

    - Timeout

    - Using tryLock()

7.  **What are thread-safe classes in Java?**\
    Examples: Vector, Hashtable, StringBuffer. These use synchronized
    methods to ensure thread safety.

8.  **What is ThreadLocal and when should it be used?**

    - Provides thread-local variables.

    - Each thread accessing such a variable has its own independent
      copy.

> java
>
> CopyEdit
>
> ThreadLocal\<Integer\> tl = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -\> 1);

9.  **How does volatile differ from synchronized?**

    - volatile ensures visibility but **not atomicity**.

    - synchronized ensures both **atomicity and visibility**.

10. **Explain the Java Memory Model (JMM).**

- Describes how threads interact through memory and what behaviors are
  allowed in multithreaded programs.

- Ensures **happens-before** relationship for correct visibility.

11. **How does ExecutorService work?**

- A high-level replacement for managing threads manually.

java

CopyEdit

ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);

executor.submit(() -\> { /\* task \*/ });

executor.shutdown();

**ðŸ”¹ Real-World Case/Design Questions**

12. **Design a thread pool or explain how to handle high-load concurrent
    requests.**

- Use ThreadPoolExecutor with proper core/max pool sizes.

- Use bounded BlockingQueue.

- Handle rejected tasks with RejectedExecutionHandler.

13. **How do you debug a deadlock in production?**

- Use jstack to dump thread info.

- Analyze waiting and locked states.

- Tools: VisualVM, JConsole.

14. **What's the difference between wait(), notify(), and notifyAll()?**

- wait(): Puts the thread in waiting state until notified.

- notify(): Wakes up one waiting thread.

- notifyAll(): Wakes up all waiting threads.

Must be used inside a synchronized block or method.

15. **What are atomic classes in Java?**

- From java.util.concurrent.atomic package, e.g., AtomicInteger.

- Provide lock-free thread-safe operations.

**ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet: Producer-Consumer Using BlockingQueue**

java

CopyEdit

BlockingQueue\<Integer\> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue\<\>(10);

Runnable producer = () -\> {

try {

while (true) {

queue.put(new Random().nextInt());

}

} catch (InterruptedException e) { }

};

Runnable consumer = () -\> {

try {

while (true) {

System.out.println(queue.take());

}

} catch (InterruptedException e) { }

};

new Thread(producer).start();

new Thread(consumer).start();

**ðŸ”¥ Advanced Java Multithreading Interview Q&A (12+ Yrs)**

**âœ… 1. What are the key challenges in multithreaded application
design?**

**Answer:**

- **Race Conditions**

- **Deadlocks**

- **Livelocks**

- **Thread starvation**

- **Context switching overhead**

- **Memory consistency (visibility issues)**

- **Testing and reproducibility**

**Cross-Question:**

How would you detect thread starvation in production?\
â†’ Use monitoring tools (e.g., Java Flight Recorder, JMC), metrics for
long waits, thread dumps.

**âœ… 2. Explain the Java Memory Model and its impact on
multithreading.**

**Answer:**

- Defines how threads interact through memory.

- Key concept: **Happens-before relationship**.

- Ensures visibility and ordering of variables between threads.

- volatile, synchronized, final, Thread.start/join establish
  happens-before relationships.

**Cross-Question:**

What's the difference between visibility and atomicity?\
â†’ Visibility = what one thread sees of another's updates; Atomicity =
indivisible operations.

**âœ… 3. How does ReentrantLock compare to synchronized?**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Feature**           **synchronized**   **ReentrantLock**
  --------------------- ------------------ --------------------------------
  Reentrant             Yes                Yes

  Timeout               No                 Yes (tryLock)

  Interruptible lock    No                 Yes (lockInterruptibly)

  Fairness              No                 Yes (optional)

  Condition support     No                 Yes
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Code Example:**

java

CopyEdit

Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(true); // fair lock

lock.lock();

try {

// critical section

} finally {

lock.unlock();

}

**Cross-Question:**

When would you prefer ReentrantLock over synchronized?\
â†’ When fairness, timed lock acquisition, or interruptible waits are
required.

**âœ… 4. What are thread-safe design patterns?**

**Answer:**

- **Immutable objects**

- **Producer-Consumer using BlockingQueue**

- **Thread Pool (using Executors)**

- **Read-Write Lock pattern**

- **Double-Checked Locking with volatile**

**âœ… 5. What is a ThreadPoolExecutor and how would you configure it for
high-throughput systems?**

**Answer:**

- Core class in Java concurrency for handling thread pools.

java

CopyEdit

ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(

10, 50, 60, TimeUnit.SECONDS,

new LinkedBlockingQueue\<\>(100),

new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());

- Tune the following:

  - corePoolSize, maximumPoolSize

  - Queue type (ArrayBlockingQueue vs LinkedBlockingQueue)

  - Rejection policy

  - Custom thread factory (for naming, priority)

**Cross-Question:**

What happens when the queue is full and all threads are busy?\
â†’ The RejectionHandler decides the fate: reject, run in caller thread,
discard, etc.

**âœ… 6. Explain the Fork/Join Framework. When would you use it?**

**Answer:**

- Introduced in Java 7 for **divide-and-conquer** tasks.

- Best suited for **recursive parallelism**, like sorting, searching, or
  matrix multiplication.

java

CopyEdit

ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();

pool.invoke(new MyRecursiveTask());

**Cross-Question:**

How does ForkJoinPool differ from ExecutorService?\
â†’ ForkJoinPool uses work-stealing, optimized for CPU-bound tasks.

**âœ… 7. Difference between wait()/notify() and Condition interface?**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Feature**        **wait/notify**        **Condition**
  ------------------ ---------------------- -----------------------------
  Locking object     Intrinsic lock         Explicit lock

  Fairness           No                     Yes

  Multiple           No (one monitor queue) Yes (many conditions per
  conditions                                lock)

  Interruptible?     No (legacy behavior)   Yes
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**âœ… 8. How do you implement a custom blocking queue without using
java.util.concurrent?**

**Answer:**

java

CopyEdit

class CustomBlockingQueue {

private Queue\<Integer\> queue = new LinkedList\<\>();

private int capacity = 10;

public synchronized void enqueue(int value) throws InterruptedException
{

while (queue.size() == capacity) wait();

queue.add(value);

notifyAll();

}

public synchronized int dequeue() throws InterruptedException {

while (queue.isEmpty()) wait();

int val = queue.poll();

notifyAll();

return val;

}

}

**Cross-Question:**

How would you add fairness here?\
â†’ Use separate condition variables or track thread arrival order.

**âœ… 9. What are some best practices you follow in production
multithreading systems?**

- Avoid using low-level synchronization unless necessary.

- Use high-level concurrency APIs: ExecutorService, ConcurrentHashMap,
  BlockingQueue.

- Profile & benchmark under real load.

- Never block on I/O in shared thread pools.

- Monitor thread states regularly (ThreadMXBean, jstack).

**âœ… 10. Have you handled deadlocks or performance bottlenecks in
production? How?**

**Answer:**\
Yes, by:

- Taking thread dumps via jstack

- Analyzing lock graphs (e.g., using VisualVM or JMC)

- Redesigning critical sections

- Minimizing lock scope

- Using lock ordering to avoid circular waits

- Replacing blocking locks with lock-free structures (e.g., Atomic\*
  classes)

**Cross-Question:**

Can you simulate a deadlock in Java?\
â†’ Yes, using two threads locking two resources in opposite order.

**âœ… 11. Explain CompletableFuture with an example.**

**Answer:**\
Used for **asynchronous programming** with callbacks, chaining, and
combining results.

java

CopyEdit

CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -\> compute())

.thenApply(data -\> transform(data))

.thenAccept(System.out::println);

**âœ… 12. What are alternatives to Java threads in reactive systems?**

- Use **Project Reactor**, **RxJava**, **Vert.x**, or **Akka**

- They follow **event-driven** and **non-blocking** models.

- Based on **reactive streams** and **backpressure** principles.
