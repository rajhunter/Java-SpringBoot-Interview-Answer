**1. What is the static keyword in Java?**

**Answer:**\
The static keyword is used for memory management. It can be applied to
variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes. When a member is
declared static:

- It belongs to the **class**, not to instances.

- It is **shared across all instances**.

**2. Where can we use static in Java?**

**Answer:**

- Static **variable** (class-level variable)

- Static **method** (can be called without object)

- Static **block** (used for static initialization)

- Static **nested class**

**3. What is a static block? When is it executed?**

**Answer:**\
A static block is used for static initialization of a class.

java

CopyEdit

static {

System.out.println(\"Static block executed\");

}

It runs **once**, when the class is first loaded by the JVM.

**Cross Question:**\
Q: What happens if you have multiple static blocks?\
A: They run in the **order they appear** in the class.

**4. Can a static method access instance variables?**

**Answer:**\
No. Static methods can only access **static data**. They cannot access
**instance variables** or **non-static methods** directly.

**Reason:** Static context does not have a reference to this.

**5. What is the output of the following?**

java

CopyEdit

class Test {

static int count = 0;

Test() {

count++;

}

public static void main(String\[\] args) {

new Test();

new Test();

System.out.println(Test.count);

}

}

**Answer:**\
2. Because count is static, it's shared across all instances.

**6. Can we override static methods in Java?**

**Answer:**\
**No**, static methods are **not overridden**, they are **hidden**.

**Example:**

java

CopyEdit

class Parent {

static void display() { System.out.println(\"Parent\"); }

}

class Child extends Parent {

static void display() { System.out.println(\"Child\"); }

}

Child.display() will call Child\'s version, but it\'s **method hiding**,
not overriding.

**7. Why can't we use this or super in static context?**

**Answer:**\
this and super refer to object instances. Static context doesn't belong
to any object, so these references are invalid.

**ðŸ”¹ Final in Java**

**1. What is the final keyword in Java?**

**Answer:**\
final means **unchangeable** or **constant**. It can be used with:

- **Variables** (cannot be reassigned)

- **Methods** (cannot be overridden)

- **Classes** (cannot be extended)

**2. Can final variables be initialized later?**

**Answer:**\
Yes, if they are:

- **Instance variables**, they can be initialized in the
  **constructor**.

- **Local variables**, they must be initialized before use.

- **Blank final variables** are allowed, but must be initialized exactly
  once.

**3. What is a final method?**

**Answer:**\
A final method **cannot be overridden** by subclasses.

**Use case:** Prevent altering base behavior in inheritance.

**4. What is a final class?**

**Answer:**\
A class marked final **cannot be extended**.\
Example: java.lang.String is a final class.

**Reason:** To ensure immutability and security.

**5. Can a final method be overloaded?**

**Answer:**\
Yes. Overloading is based on method **signature**, not inheritance.
Final restricts **overriding**, not **overloading**.

**6. Is final variable thread-safe?**

**Answer:**\
Yes. Once a final variable is constructed and assigned, it is guaranteed
to be visible correctly across threads. Especially useful in **immutable
objects**.

**7. What happens if you try to reassign a final variable?**

java

CopyEdit

final int x = 10;

x = 20; // Compilation error

**Answer:**\
Compile-time error: cannot assign a value to final variable x.

**8. Can a final reference variable point to a different object?**

**Answer:**\
No. But the object it points to **can be modified**, if mutable.

java

CopyEdit

final List\<String\> list = new ArrayList\<\>();

list.add(\"A\"); // OK

list = new ArrayList\<\>(); // Compilation error

**9. Can we declare a constructor as final?**

**Answer:**\
No. Constructors are **not inherited**, so there\'s no point in marking
them final.

**10. What is the difference between static final and final static?**

**Answer:**\
No difference. Order of keywords does **not matter** in Java modifiers.

java

CopyEdit

static final int MAX = 10; // same as final static int MAX = 10;

**ðŸ”¶ Real-World Examples**

**âœ… static Example --- Utility Class**

java

CopyEdit

public class MathUtils {

public static int square(int x) {

return x \* x;

}

}

MathUtils.square(5); // No object needed

**Use case:** Logging utilities, helper methods, constants, or singleton
accessors.

**âœ… final Example --- Immutable Config**

java

CopyEdit

public final class Config {

public static final String APP_NAME = \"InvoiceManager\";

}

**Use case:** Constants, security (prevent subclassing), enforcing
business rules.

**âœ… abstract Example --- Template Design Pattern**

java

CopyEdit

public abstract class PaymentProcessor {

public abstract void authenticate();

public void process() {

authenticate();

System.out.println(\"Transaction completed.\");

}

}

**Use case:** Define *skeleton* behavior for subclasses (e.g., Spring's
AbstractController).

**âœ… synchronized Example --- Thread-safe Counter**

java

CopyEdit

public class Counter {

private int count = 0;

public synchronized void increment() {

count++;

}

public synchronized int getCount() {

return count;

}

}

**Use case:** Bank transactions, shared resource access (e.g.,
messaging, counters, cache updates).

**ðŸ”¶ Coding Exercises**

**ðŸ§ª 1. Static vs Instance**

java

CopyEdit

class Employee {

static int employeeCount = 0;

int empId;

public Employee(int id) {

empId = id;

employeeCount++;

}

public static int getEmployeeCount() {

return employeeCount;

}

}

**Q:** What is the output of:

java

CopyEdit

new Employee(101);

new Employee(102);

System.out.println(Employee.getEmployeeCount());

âœ… **Answer:** 2 --- because employeeCount is static.

**ðŸ§ª 2. Final Variable Initialization**

java

CopyEdit

public class Vehicle {

final String model;

public Vehicle(String model) {

this.model = model;

}

public void printModel() {

System.out.println(\"Model: \" + model);

}

}

**Q:** Can model be reassigned later?\
âœ… **Answer:** No --- final instance variables must be assigned once.

**ðŸ§ª 3. Abstract Method Implementation**

java

CopyEdit

abstract class Shape {

abstract double area();

}

class Circle extends Shape {

double radius;

Circle(double r) { radius = r; }

\@Override

double area() {

return Math.PI \* radius \* radius;

}

}

**Q:** What happens if you forget to implement area() in Circle?

âœ… **Answer:** Compile-time error --- abstract method must be
implemented in a concrete subclass.

**ðŸ§ª 4. Synchronized Method Test**

java

CopyEdit

class Printer {

public synchronized void print(String doc) {

System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \": Printing \" +
doc);

}

}

**Q:** What is the output if two threads try to print at the same time?

âœ… **Answer:** Only one thread prints at a time --- due to
synchronization.

**ðŸ”¶ Summary of Best Practices**

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Keyword**    **Best Practice**
  -------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  static         Use for constants and utility methods. Avoid static state
                 in multithreading.

  final          Prefer final fields for immutability and thread-safety.

  abstract       Use in frameworks or when designing base template classes.

  synchronized   Use only when necessary. Consider ReentrantLock or
                 java.util.concurrent.
