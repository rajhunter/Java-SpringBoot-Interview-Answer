Here's a **more detailed, deep dive version** of the sequence diagram
and related architecture flow---describing components, design decisions,
error handling, security, and reliability patterns.

**üìò Deep Dive: Service Bus + Cosmos DB Sequence Flow**

**Participants:**

- **User**: Initiates order placement via REST API.

- **OrderService**: Handles HTTP request, persists order, publishes
  events.

- **Azure Service Bus**: Reliable message broker; topics and
  subscriptions.

- **InventoryService**: Subscribes to order events, handles stock logic.

- **BillingService**: Subscribes to order events, handles invoicing
  logic.

- **Cosmos DB**: Globally distributed NoSQL database for persisting
  order, invoice, and inventory data.

**üîÅ Step-by-Step with Design Considerations**

**1. User ‚ûú OrderService (HTTP POST /orders)**

- **OrderService** receives a REST call.

- **Validation**: Apply input validation (schema, business rules),
  authentication via JWT/Azure AD, and authorization.

**2. OrderService ‚ûú Cosmos DB (Save Order)**

- Persist order with status Pending.

- Use an **idempotency token** to avoid duplicate orders.

- Use a strong partition key (e.g., /customerId) for even distribution
  and efficient querying.

**3. OrderService ‚ûú Service Bus (Publish OrderCreatedEvent)**

- Use a **Service Bus Topic** (e.g., orders) with subscriptions for
  Inventory and Billing.

- Event contains structured payload: orderId, customerId, items\[\],
  timestamp, maybe totalPrice.

- Implement **duplicate detection** (e.g., MessageId = orderId) so
  Service Bus avoids duplicate deliveries.

- Use **transactional integration** if possible---e.g., sending the
  event in the same transaction as the Cosmos DB write using the outbox
  pattern or Azure Functions with consistency guarantees.

**4. Service Bus ‚ûú InventoryService / BillingService**

- **InventoryService** and **BillingService** each have separate
  subscriptions; they receive messages independently.

- **Peek-Lock delivery mode**: manual complete after processing, to
  avoid losing messages on failure.

- If processing fails or locking times out, Service Bus will redeliver
  (up to maxDeliveryCount).

**5. InventoryService ‚ûú Cosmos DB (Update Inventory)**

- Decrement stock counts for ordered items.

- If insufficient inventory ‚Üí publish a compensation or failure event
  back to OrderService (e.g., OrderInventoryFailedEvent).

- Use Cosmos DB's **optimistic concurrency** control (ETags) to avoid
  race conditions when multiple orders for same SKU arrive concurrently.

**6. BillingService ‚ûú Cosmos DB (Create Invoice)**

- Generates invoice record linked with orderId.

- Use snapshot pricing to avoid price inconsistency.

- Store invoice status and payment link if integrated with payment
  gateways.

**7. InventoryService & BillingService ‚ûú OrderService (Status Update)**

- After successful operations, each service can publish internal events
  or call OrderService endpoints:

  - InventoryService ‚ûú OrderService: InventoryConfirmed(orderId)

  - BillingService ‚ûú OrderService: InvoiceCreated(orderId)

- Alternatively, both services could publish events in Service Bus
  (e.g., OrderReadyEvent) that OrderService subscribes to.

- **Idempotent update logic**: avoid double-updates for the same event.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Concern**     **Pattern / Tool Used**
  --------------- ----------------------------------------------------------

  Guarantee       

  Duplicate       Message‚ÄëId use, idempotent services, conditional writes in
  Handling        Cosmos

  Error Recovery  Redirect messages to **Dead‚ÄëLetter Queue**, enable
                  **auto-forward** to error handler queue

  Observability   Use **Application Insights**, **Service Bus Metrics**,
                  **Cosmos DB diagnostics**, and **Correlation IDs** across
                  services

  Security        Use **Managed Identities** for RBAC access to Service Bus
                  and Cosmos DB; TLS encryption; encrypted at rest (Cosmos
                  DB automatically, Service Bus using TLS)

  Scalability     Scale out consumers (Inventory/Billing) independently;
                  Cosmos DB autoscale; multiple partitions; Service Bus
                  partitioned topics

end

**‚úÖ Summary**

- The architecture uses **Azure Service Bus Topics** for asynchronous,
  event-driven communication.

- **Service Bus duplication detection** + **idempotent service logic**
  ensures safe reprocessing.

- **Cosmos DB partitioning and optimistic concurrency control** ensure
  low-latency and consistent data operations.

- Failure handling is built with DLQ, compensation events, or status
  rollback flows.

- Security is enforced via **Managed Identity**, **RBAC**, TLS, and
  encryption.

**Enhanced Sequence Flow (With Technical Details)**

**üß≠ Use Case:**

A user places an order. The system publishes the order to Azure Service
Bus. Inventory and Billing services subscribe, process the message,
persist to Cosmos DB, and send acknowledgements.

**üîê System Design Deep Dive**

**‚úÖ 1. Message Processing Guarantees**

- **Peek-Lock** pattern used (default in Azure Service Bus) ensures
  at-least-once delivery.

- Manual completion of message prevents data loss and ensures only
  successful transactions are committed.

**‚úÖ 2. Idempotency & Deduplication**

- InventoryService & BillingService must **check if they've already
  processed** the message.

  - Use **OrderID** or **MessageId**.

  - Store processing logs or status flags in CosmosDB.

**‚úÖ 3. Durability & Retry**

- Messages not completed within lock timeout get re-delivered.

- Use **exponential backoff with jitter** in subscribers.

- Unprocessable messages moved to **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)** after max
  retries.

**‚úÖ 4. Observability & Tracing**

- Use **Azure Monitor**, **App Insights**, or **OpenTelemetry**.

- Tag all messages/events with:

  - CorrelationId

  - SessionId = OrderID

  - Traceparent (for distributed tracing)

**‚úÖ 5. Data Consistency**

- OrderService initially saves status as NEW.

- InventoryService updates status to INVENTORY_OK.

- BillingService updates status to BILLED.

- You can use **Change Feed in Cosmos DB** to asynchronously trigger
  downstream flows (like notification or shipping).
