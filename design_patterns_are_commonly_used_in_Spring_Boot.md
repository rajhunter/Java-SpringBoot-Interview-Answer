**‚úÖ 1. What design patterns are commonly used in Spring Boot?**

**Answer:**\
Spring Boot uses several design patterns extensively:

- **Singleton** -- Beans are singleton by default in Spring.

- **Factory Method** -- Used in BeanFactory and ApplicationContext.

- **Proxy** -- Used for AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming).

- **Template Method** -- Seen in JDBC Template, RestTemplate, etc.

- **Dependency Injection (DI)** -- Core pattern used in Spring.

- **Builder** -- Used in creating complex objects like HttpHeaders,
  UriComponentsBuilder.

- **Observer** -- Event handling in Spring (ApplicationEventPublisher).

- **Strategy** -- For interchangeable algorithms (e.g., custom
  validation, sorting logic).

- **Adapter** -- For integration with external APIs or frameworks.

**‚úÖ 2. Explain how the Singleton pattern is implemented in Spring
Boot.**

**Answer:**

- By default, Spring beans are **singleton-scoped**.

- Only **one instance** of a bean is created per Spring container.

- This is managed internally by the **ApplicationContext** or
  **BeanFactory**.

java

CopyEdit

\@Service

public class MyService {

// Singleton by default

}

Cross-question: *How to make a prototype bean instead of singleton?*\
Use \@Scope(\"prototype\").

**‚úÖ 3. Where is the Factory design pattern used in Spring Boot?**

**Answer:**

- Used in **BeanFactory** and **ApplicationContext**.

- Spring uses **factory methods** to instantiate beans.

- Example: \@Bean methods can act like factories.

java

CopyEdit

\@Configuration

public class AppConfig {

\@Bean

public MyService myService() {

return new MyServiceImpl(); // Factory method

}

}

**‚úÖ 4. How does Spring implement the Proxy pattern?**

**Answer:**

- Used in **AOP** and **transaction management**.

- Creates **proxy objects** around beans using:

  - JDK Dynamic Proxies (for interfaces)

  - CGLIB Proxies (for concrete classes)

java

CopyEdit

\@Transaction

public void updateAccount() {

// Proxy intercepts method to apply transaction logic

}

**‚úÖ 5. What is the Template Method pattern? Where is it used in
Spring?**

**Answer:**

- A base class defines the **skeleton** of an algorithm.

- Subclasses override specific steps.

- Used in:

  - JdbcTemplate

  - RestTemplate

  - TransactionTemplate

java

CopyEdit

jdbcTemplate.query(\"SELECT \* FROM users\", new RowMapper\<User\>() {

public User mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) {

return new User(rs.getString(\"name\"));

}

});

**‚úÖ 6. How does Dependency Injection relate to design patterns?**

**Answer:**

- It\'s based on **Inversion of Control (IoC)**.

- Achieved using:

  - Constructor Injection

  - Setter Injection

  - Field Injection (not recommended)

java

CopyEdit

\@Service

public class OrderService {

private final PaymentService paymentService;

\@Autowired

public OrderService(PaymentService paymentService) {

this.paymentService = paymentService;

}

}

**‚úÖ 7. Describe how the Strategy pattern is applied in Spring Boot.**

**Answer:**

- You define **interchangeable behaviors** and inject them based on
  conditions.

- Example: Implementing payment gateways.

java

CopyEdit

public interface PaymentStrategy {

void pay();

}

\@Component(\"creditCard\")

public class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {

public void pay() { /\* logic \*/ }

}

\@Component(\"paypal\")

public class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {

public void pay() { /\* logic \*/ }

}

\@Service

public class PaymentService {

\@Autowired

\@Qualifier(\"creditCard\")

private PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy;

}

Cross-question: *How can we make this dynamic at runtime?*\
Use a Map\<String, PaymentStrategy\> and fetch the strategy using a key.

**‚úÖ 8. Can you explain the Observer pattern in the Spring framework?**

**Answer:**

- Spring uses **Observer** in its **event mechanism**:

  - ApplicationEventPublisher publishes events.

  - Listeners receive and react to events.

java

CopyEdit

\@Component

public class MyListener {

\@EventListener

public void handleCustomEvent(CustomEvent event) {

// React to event

}

}

**‚úÖ 9. What is the role of Builder pattern in Spring Boot?**

**Answer:**

- Used to build **complex objects** step-by-step.

- Examples:

  - ResponseEntity

  - UriComponentsBuilder

  - HttpHeaders

java

CopyEdit

ResponseEntity.ok()

.header(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")

.body(\"response\");

**‚úÖ 10. Where is the Adapter pattern used in Spring?**

**Answer:**

- Used to **integrate third-party APIs**.

- Spring MVC uses HandlerAdapter to adapt various HandlerMapping
  strategies.

**‚úÖ 1. What design patterns have you actively used in large-scale
Spring Boot applications?**

**Answer:**\
In my 12+ years of experience, I have implemented the following patterns
with Spring Boot:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Design Pattern**  **Use Case in Spring Boot Application**
  ------------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  Singleton           Spring beans by default --- service, repository,
                      utility classes.

  Factory             Bean creation using \@Bean, dynamic service
                      providers.

  Proxy               AOP logging, security, retry logic via declarative
                      proxies.

  Strategy            Dynamic business rules (e.g., promo engine, payment
                      gateway).

  Template Method     Abstract reusable flows (e.g., CSV/XML parser
                      template).

  Builder             REST API response builders, domain object creation.

  Observer            Event-based architecture using Spring's
                      ApplicationEvent.

  Chain of            Spring Security filter chains, middleware
  Responsibility      pipelines.

  Adapter             Third-party service integrations like legacy SOAP
                      to REST.

  Command             Decoupling tasks in microservice orchestrations.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**‚úÖ 2. Can you describe a real use of the Strategy Pattern in a Spring
Boot microservice?**

**Answer:**\
I implemented a dynamic **pricing strategy** service in a travel
application. Depending on booking source (web/mobile/agent), different
discount logic applied:

java

CopyEdit

public interface PricingStrategy {

BigDecimal calculateFare(Booking booking);

}

\@Component(\"agentStrategy\")

public class AgentPricingStrategy implements PricingStrategy { \... }

\@Component(\"webStrategy\")

public class WebPricingStrategy implements PricingStrategy { \... }

\@Service

public class PricingService {

\@Autowired private Map\<String, PricingStrategy\> strategies;

public BigDecimal calculate(String channel, Booking booking) {

return strategies.get(channel + \"Strategy\").calculateFare(booking);

}

}

üîÅ **Cross-question:**\
*How would you manage hundreds of such strategies?*\
‚Üí Group by feature, apply Factory pattern with config-based bean
resolution.

**‚úÖ 3. Explain how Proxy and AOP enable cross-cutting concerns in
Spring Boot.**

**Answer:**

- **Spring AOP** uses **proxy pattern** (JDK Dynamic Proxy or CGLIB) to
  wrap beans.

- It enables adding functionality like logging, transaction, security,
  without modifying actual business logic.

java

CopyEdit

\@Aspect

\@Component

public class LoggingAspect {

\@Before(\"execution(\* com.myapp.service..\*(..))\")

public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {

log.info(\"Calling: \" + joinPoint.getSignature());

}

}

üîÅ **Cross-question:**\
*How would AOP behave with self-invocation?*\
‚Üí Proxy won't intercept self-calls; need to refactor into separate beans
or use AspectJ.

**‚úÖ 4. How have you used the Builder pattern to improve code
readability and testability?**

**Answer:**

- Used **Builder pattern** for constructing immutable domain models
  (e.g., BookingRequest, FlightDetails).

- Helps in clean unit tests and reduces constructor clutter.

java

CopyEdit

BookingRequest request = BookingRequest.builder()

.flightId(\"AI101\")

.userId(\"user1\")

.seatClass(\"Economy\")

.build();

üîÅ **Cross-question:**\
*How does Lombok's \@Builder help here?*\
‚Üí Reduces boilerplate, supports method chaining, works well with
immutability.

**‚úÖ 5. Describe a use case where you used the Observer pattern in a
decoupled event-driven design.**

**Answer:**\
In an e-commerce app, on successful payment, I needed to:

- Send confirmation email

- Update inventory

- Notify third-party analytics

Instead of tightly coupling, I used Spring Events:

java

CopyEdit

\@Component

public class PaymentService {

\@Autowired private ApplicationEventPublisher publisher;

public void processPayment(Order order) {

// logic

publisher.publishEvent(new PaymentSuccessEvent(order));

}

}

java

CopyEdit

\@EventListener

public void sendEmail(PaymentSuccessEvent event) {

// handle separately

}

üîÅ **Cross-question:**\
*What are pitfalls?*

- Events are async (unless annotated), error handling is tricky.

- Use Transactional Events or Spring Cloud Stream for better guarantees.

**‚úÖ 6. How have you implemented the Chain of Responsibility pattern
using Spring Security filters?**

**Answer:**\
Spring Security uses this pattern internally:

- Authentication ‚Üí Authorization ‚Üí CSRF ‚Üí Headers ‚Üí Logout

Custom implementation example:

java

CopyEdit

\@Component

public class IpBlacklistFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {

protected void doFilterInternal(\...) {

// check if IP is blacklisted

filterChain.doFilter(request, response);

}

}

Then add this filter to the security chain:

java

CopyEdit

http.addFilterBefore(new IpBlacklistFilter(),
UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);

**‚úÖ 7. Can you explain the difference between Factory and Abstract
Factory in Spring context?**

**Answer:**

- **Factory Pattern**: Simple creation logic; used via \@Bean,
  FactoryBean, etc.

- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Families of related objects without
  specifying concrete classes.

Use case:\
Abstract factory for generating platform-specific beans (e.g., AWS,
Azure, GCP services) based on environment.

**‚úÖ 8. How would you use Template Method pattern for service layer
abstraction?**

**Answer:**\
Created an **abstract template service** to handle audit, logging, and
retry logic:

java

CopyEdit

public abstract class AbstractServiceTemplate\<T\> {

public final Response execute(T request) {

preProcess(request);

Response result = process(request);

postProcess(result);

return result;

}

protected abstract Response process(T request);

}

Each microservice then extends and overrides only business logic.

**‚úÖ 9. How do you handle design patterns in a distributed microservices
architecture?**

**Answer:**\
Used combinations:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Pattern**   **Use Case in Microservices**
  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
  Circuit       Resilience4j or Hystrix for failing dependencies.
  Breaker       

  Adapter       Integrate with legacy services or third-party APIs.

  Command       Represent service calls with retry/fallback (e.g., Command
                Pattern in orchestration).

  Aggregator    Gateway pattern to collect data from multiple services.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

**‚úÖ 10. What are anti-patterns to avoid when using design patterns in
Spring Boot?**

**Answer:**

- Overusing Singleton for stateful beans.

- Abusing Proxy logic (e.g., too many aspects ‚Üí performance hit).

- Using Factory without externalizing config (tight-coupling).

- Writing too many Abstract classes -- prefer composition over
  inheritance.

- Not handling event-driven failures (in Observer/Event patterns).
