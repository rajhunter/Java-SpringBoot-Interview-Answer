**âœ… 1. What is JDK, JRE, and JVM?**

**Answer:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Component**      **Description**
  ------------------ ----------------------------------------------------
  **JDK (Java        It\'s a software development kit used to develop
  Development Kit)** Java applications. It includes JRE + development
                     tools (javac, javadoc, etc.).

  **JRE (Java        It\'s a runtime environment that includes JVM +
  Runtime            libraries for running Java applications.
  Environment)**     

  **JVM (Java        It\'s a virtual engine that runs the bytecode and
  Virtual Machine)** provides abstraction from underlying OS/hardware.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Follow-up:**\
ðŸ‘‰ *Is JVM platform-dependent?*\
**Answer:** JVM is platform-dependent because its implementation differs
across OS. But Java is platform-independent due to the JVM.

**âœ… 2. Is JVM part of JRE or JDK?**

**Answer:** JVM is part of JRE.\
JRE is part of JDK.\
Thus, JDK âŠƒ JRE âŠƒ JVM.

**âœ… 3. Can you run Java code without JDK?**

**Answer:** Yes, if the code is already compiled into bytecode (.class),
you can run it using **JRE**, which contains the JVM.\
To compile Java source code (.java), **JDK** is required.

**ChatGPT said:**

Updated saved memory

Here are **advanced JVM, JRE, and JDK interview questions and answers**
specifically curated for **12+ years of experience**. These are the
kinds of questions you\'d face in **architect-level, senior developer,
or Java performance tuning interviews**.

**ðŸ”¥ 1. Explain the complete JVM architecture with internal
components.**

**Answer:**\
JVM components:

- **ClassLoader Subsystem** (Bootstrap, Extension, Application)

- **Runtime Data Areas**:

  - **Method Area**: class-level data (static vars, method code)

  - **Heap**: object instances (young, old, metaspace in Java 8+)

  - **JVM Stack**: each thread has its own stack frame

  - **Program Counter (PC)**: per-thread, tracks bytecode execution

  - **Native Method Stack**

- **Execution Engine**:

  - **Interpreter**

  - **Garbage Collector (GC)**

- **Native Interface (JNI)**

- **Native Method Libraries**

**Cross-question:**\
ðŸ‘‰ What changes happened in Metaspace vs PermGen?\
**Answer:** PermGen was removed in Java 8. Metaspace grows dynamically
and is OS-dependent.

**ðŸ”¥ 2. What are common JVM tuning parameters used in production?**

**Answer:**

bash

CopyEdit

-Xms1G \# Initial heap size

-Xmx4G \# Max heap size

-Xss512k \# Thread stack size

-XX:MetaspaceSize=128M \# Initial metaspace size

-XX:+UseG1GC \# Use G1 Garbage Collector

-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError

-XX:HeapDumpPath=/path/to/dump.hprof

-XX:+PrintGCDetails -Xloggc:gc.log

**ðŸ”¥ 3. How does JVM manage memory across threads and GC?**

**Answer:**

- Each thread has its own **JVM stack** and **PC Register**.

- **Heap** is shared.

- GC pauses impact all threads during **stop-the-world (STW)** events.

- G1/ZGC/Shenandoah try to reduce pause times by region-based GC or
  concurrent processing.

**ðŸ”¥ 4. Explain the lifecycle of a Java class in the JVM.**

**Answer:**

1.  **Loading** -- ClassLoader reads .class file.

2.  **Linking**

    - Verification

    - Preparation (static vars default values)

    - Resolution (symbolic references â†’ actual)

3.  **Initialization** -- Static initializers and static blocks.

4.  **Using**

5.  **Unloading** -- Done by GC only if class is no longer referenced.

**Cross-question:**\
ðŸ‘‰ When is a class unloaded?\
**Answer:** Only when the classloader that loaded it is garbage
collected.

**ðŸ”¥ 5. What are different types of classloaders?**

**Answer:**

- **Bootstrap** -- loads core Java classes (rt.jar)

- **Extension (Platform)** -- loads from lib/ext or Java modules

- **Application** -- loads from classpath

- **Custom/User-defined** -- for special isolation or instrumentation
  (e.g., Tomcat, OSGi)

**Follow-up:**\
ðŸ‘‰ Can two classes with the same name exist in JVM?\
**Answer:** Yes, if loaded by different classloaders.

**ðŸ”¥ 6. How do you troubleshoot memory leaks in Java?**

**Answer:**

- Analyze heap dumps with **MAT** or **VisualVM**

- Enable GC logging

- Use **reference leak detection** tools like **YourKit**, **jProfiler**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **GC Algorithm** **Strength**                          **Weakness**
  ---------------- ------------------------------------- --------------------
  **G1**           Low pause time, parallelism,          May still cause STW
                   region-based                          

  **CMS**          Concurrent, low pause (deprecated)    Fragmentation

  **ZGC**          Sub-millisecond pause times, scales   Java 11+ only
                   to TBs                                

  **Shenandoah**   Pause-time independent of heap size   Available in OpenJDK
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ðŸ”¥ 8. What is bytecode verification in JVM?**

**Answer:**\
Before execution, the JVM verifies that bytecode:

- Has valid structure

- Follows access rules

- Doesn't overflow the operand stack\
  This prevents **malicious code** execution.

**ðŸ”¥ 9. How does the JIT compiler optimize Java code?**

**Answer:**

- Inlines hot methods

- Eliminates dead code

- Performs **loop unrolling**

- Uses **escape analysis** to allocate objects on stack instead of heap

**Cross-question:**\
ðŸ‘‰ What is escape analysis?\
**Answer:** Determines if an object can be **safely allocated on the
stack** instead of the heap.

**ðŸ”¥ 10. What is Code Cache in JVM?**

**Answer:**

- Memory area where JIT-compiled native code is stored.

- Controlled by ReservedCodeCacheSize

- Too small code cache can cause CodeCacheFull warnings and degraded
  performance.

**ðŸ”¥ 11. How do you monitor and diagnose JVM at runtime?**

**Answer:**

- **JMX**, **jconsole**, **VisualVM**

- jstat, jstack, jmap, jcmd

- Application Performance Monitoring tools: **New Relic**,
  **Dynatrace**, **AppDynamics**

**ðŸ”¥ 12. Explain metaspace tuning in Java 8+.**

**Answer:**\
Metaspace holds class metadata (replaced PermGen).\
Tuned using:

- -XX:MetaspaceSize

- -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize

**ðŸ”¥ 13. What happens during a Stop-the-World (STW) event?**

**Answer:**\
All application threads are paused so JVM can safely:

- Perform GC

- Resize heap or compact memory

- Collect diagnostic data

**Tuning tip:** Use concurrent collectors to minimize STW.

**ðŸ”¥ 14. How does JVM handle thread scheduling?**

**Answer:**\
Delegated to the **OS thread scheduler**. Java threads map to **native
threads** (1:1). JVM only ensures **synchronization** and **lock
semantics**, not strict thread priority enforcement.

**ðŸ”¥ 15. Can JVM memory be fragmented?**

**Answer:**\
Yes. Especially in **CMS**, where heap fragmentation can cause OOM even
if memory is available. G1 and ZGC reduce fragmentation via
**compaction**.

**ðŸ”¥ 16. What is the difference between interpreter and JIT in JVM?**

**Answer:**

- **Interpreter** executes bytecode line-by-line (slow startup).

- **JIT** compiles hot bytecode paths to native code (faster execution
  after warm-up).

**ðŸ”¥ 17. What is the default GC in Java 8 and Java 11+?**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Version**           **Default GC**
  --------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  Java 8                Parallel GC

  Java 11               G1 GC

  Java 17+              G1 (or ZGC as opt-in)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**ðŸ”¥ 18. What is jlink and how does it relate to JDK?**

**Answer:**\
jlink allows creating a **custom runtime image** from JDK modules.
Reduces JDK footprint, useful for containers and microservices.

**ðŸ”¥ 19. What is GraalVM and how is it different from JVM?**

**Answer:**\
GraalVM is a high-performance runtime supporting **Java, JS, Python**,
etc.

- Supports **AOT (native-image)** compilation.

- Faster startup, low memory footprint

- Replaces HotSpot's JIT

**ðŸ”¥ 20. Can you create your own JVM?**

**Answer:**\
Yes, by implementing the **Java Virtual Machine Specification**.
Examples: HotSpot, OpenJ9, GraalVM. You must support class loading,
bytecode execution, GC, and threading.
