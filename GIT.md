**GIT - Core Version Control**

**1. What is Git and how does it work?**

**Answer:**\
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in
source code during software development. Each developer has a full copy
of the project history. Git uses snapshots (commits) rather than
differences and supports branches and merges efficiently.

**2. Explain the Git workflow.**

**Answer:**\
Common Git workflow:

- git clone -- Copy repo

- git checkout -b feature-branch -- New branch

- git add . -- Stage changes

- git commit -m \"msg\" -- Commit

- git pull origin main -- Sync with remote

- git push origin feature-branch -- Push

- Create Pull Request for code review/merge

**3. What are the states in Git?**

**Answer:**

- **Working Directory** -- Modified files

- **Staging Area (Index)** -- Staged for commit

- **Local Repository** -- Committed files

- **Remote Repository** -- Shared on server

**4. Difference between git fetch and git pull?**

**Answer:**

- git fetch: Retrieves changes from remote but doesn\'t merge.

- git pull: Fetch + Merge.

**5. What is a rebase? How is it different from merge?**

**Answer:**

- **Merge**: Combines histories of two branches; may create merge
  commits.

- **Rebase**: Re-applies commits on top of another base; creates linear
  history.

Use rebase in feature branches, merge in main branches.

**6. What is the difference between origin, upstream, and head?**

**Answer:**

- origin: Default name for remote repository.

- upstream: The original repo forked from.

- HEAD: Current branch\'s latest commit reference.

**7. How do you resolve merge conflicts?**

**Answer:**

- git status to see conflicting files.

- Manually edit conflicts (look for \<\<\<\<\<\<\<).

- git add \<file\> after resolving.

- git commit to finalize.

**üíª GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket / Stash**

**8. How do GitHub and Git differ?**

**Answer:**\
Git is the version control system; GitHub is a cloud-based hosting
platform for Git repositories with collaboration features like PRs,
issues, and actions.

**9. What is a Pull Request (PR) in GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket?**

**Answer:**\
A PR is a request to merge code from one branch to another (often
feature ‚Üí main). It allows for code review, CI checks, and discussions.

**10. How do GitLab pipelines differ from GitHub Actions?**

**Answer:**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Feature**        **GitLab CI/CD**     **GitHub Actions**
  ------------------ -------------------- --------------------------------
  YAML file          .gitlab-ci.yml       .github/workflows/\*.yml

  Built-in Runner    Yes                  Optional

  Monorepo Support   Advanced             Less advanced

  Cost               Free tiers + Paid    Free tiers + Paid
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

**11. Explain GitLab Flow.**

**Answer:**\
GitLab Flow combines feature-driven development with CI/CD. It supports:

- Environment branches

- Code review and testing pipelines

- Merge requests as the deployment trigger

**12. How do you manage permissions in GitHub vs GitLab vs Bitbucket?**

**Answer:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Tool**     **Permission Levels**
  ------------ ----------------------------------------------------------
  GitHub       Read, Triage, Write, Maintain, Admin

  GitLab       Guest, Reporter, Developer, Maintainer, Owner

  Bitbucket    Read, Write, Admin (at repo and project level)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**13. Difference between GitHub and Bitbucket?**

**Answer:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Feature**       **GitHub**             **Bitbucket**
  ----------------- ---------------------- ------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**14. What is Atlassian Stash?**

**Answer:**\
Atlassian Stash (now **Bitbucket Server**) is an on-premise Git
repository management tool, useful for enterprise-grade control and
integration with Jira, Bamboo, etc.

**15. Scenario: You accidentally committed secrets. How would you remove
them?**

**Answer:**

1.  Remove from file.

2.  Run git rm \--cached \<file\>

3.  Commit and push.

4.  Use tools like git filter-branch or BFG Repo-Cleaner to clean
    history.

5.  Force push: git push \--force

**16. How do you squash commits?**

**Answer:**

bash

CopyEdit

git rebase -i HEAD\~n

\# pick ‚Üí squash (for older commits)

git push \--force

**17. How do you enforce code quality in GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket?**

**Answer:**

- PR templates

- Required reviews

- Status checks (CI/CD)

- Code coverage reports

- Protected branches

- Static analysis integrations (e.g., SonarQube)

**18. What is a Git tag? When do you use it?**

**Answer:**\
Git tags are used to mark release points (v1.0, v2.1).

bash

CopyEdit

git tag v1.0

git push origin v1.0

**19. How to revert a commit already pushed to remote?**

**Answer:**

bash

CopyEdit

git revert \<commit_hash\> \# Safe, creates a new commit

git push origin main

**20. How do you enforce branch policies in GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket?**

**Answer:**

- Enable protected branches

- Require PRs with approvals

- Restrict direct push

- Enable CI/CD status checks

- Use CODEOWNERS for mandatory review

**‚úÖ 1. Why use rebase if merge is safer?**

**Answer:**

- git merge preserves the complete history (safe, traceable), but can
  create **noisy commit history** with unnecessary merge commits.

- git rebase creates a **clean, linear history**, ideal for feature
  branch workflows.

**Use rebase when:**

- You want a **tidy commit history** (especially before merging feature
  branches).

- Working in **small teams** or solo, where history rewriting risk is
  minimal.

- You want to **replay local commits** on top of the updated remote base
  (main or develop).

**Why it can be risky:**

- Rewrites commit hashes.

- Not suitable for shared branches (can cause divergence/conflicts).

üîÅ **Best practice:**

- Rebase locally before PR (git pull \--rebase).

- Avoid rebasing public/shared branches.

**‚úÖ 2. When would you use GitHub Actions over Jenkins?**

**Answer:**

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Criteria**    **GitHub Actions**        **Jenkins**
  --------------- ------------------------- --------------------------------
  Setup           Native to GitHub, zero    Requires installation, plugins,
                  infra setup               server

  Use case        Fast CI/CD for GitHub     Complex, enterprise-grade CI/CD
                  projects                  

  Cost            Free for public repos,    Requires hosting
                  free tier for private     (self-hosted/cloud)

  Extensibility   GitHub Marketplace        Plugin ecosystem

  Integration     Seamless GitHub           Needs webhook configuration
                  integration               

  Secrets         Built-in                  Requires setup (Vault or Jenkins
  management                                Credentials Plugin)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

‚úÖ **Use GitHub Actions when:**

- You use GitHub as VCS.

- You want fast, integrated CI/CD.

- You need **simple pipelines** with minimal config.

- You want **event-driven workflows** (push, PR, issue comment).

**‚úÖ 3. How do you set up CI/CD using GitLab pipeline with Docker
runners?**

**Answer:**

**Steps to set up GitLab CI/CD:**

1.  **Define .gitlab-ci.yml:**

yaml

CopyEdit

stages:

\- build

\- test

\- deploy

build:

stage: build

script:

\- docker build -t my-app .

test:

stage: test

script:

\- docker run my-app npm test

deploy:

stage: deploy

script:

\- ./deploy.sh

2.  **Register Docker runner:**

bash

CopyEdit

sudo gitlab-runner register

\# Choose \'docker\' as executor

3.  **Configure Docker in config.toml:**

toml

CopyEdit

\[\[runners\]\]

name = \"docker-runner\"

executor = \"docker\"

\[runners.docker\]

image = \"node:16\"

privileged = true

4.  **Push .gitlab-ci.yml to repo** -- pipeline triggers automatically.

üí°**Advanced:** Use Docker-in-Docker (DinD) for full container
workflows:

yaml

CopyEdit

services:

\- docker:dind

**‚úÖ 4. How do you use Git submodules and what are the risks?**

**Answer:**

**Submodules:** Allow embedding one Git repo as a sub-directory of
another.

bash

CopyEdit

git submodule add \<repo_url\> path/to/dir

git submodule update \--init \--recursive

**Use Cases:**

- Reuse shared libraries across multiple projects.

- Isolate dependencies that are actively version-controlled.

**Risks:**

- **Extra maintenance overhead** -- each submodule has its own commit
  tracking.

- Can easily get **out of sync**.

- CI/CD complexity increases (requires recursive clones).

- New team members often forget to init/update them.

‚úÖ **Alternatives:** Git subtree, or dependency management tools (Maven,
npm, etc.)

**‚úÖ 5. Can you recover a deleted remote branch?**

**Answer:**\
Yes --- **only if you or someone else has the branch locally or knows
the commit hash**.

**Option 1: Recover using reflog (locally):**

bash

CopyEdit

git reflog

\# Find the last known commit of the branch

git checkout -b deleted-branch \<commit_hash\>

git push origin deleted-branch

**Option 2: Another dev has local copy:**

bash

CopyEdit

git checkout \<branch\>

git push origin \<branch\>

**Option 3: From CI/CD logs or PRs:**

- Extract commit hash from PR or CI logs, then recreate branch:

bash

CopyEdit

git checkout -b recovered-branch \<commit_hash\>

git push origin recovered-branch

üí°**Tip:** Avoid accidental deletions by:

- Protecting main branches

- Setting branch deletion policies
