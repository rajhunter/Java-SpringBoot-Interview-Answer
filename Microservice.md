**✅ 1. What is Monolithic Architecture?**

**Answer:**\
Monolithic architecture is a unified model where all modules---UI,
business logic, and data access---are tightly coupled and deployed as a
single application.

**Pros:**

- Simple to develop and deploy

- Easier debugging and tracing

**Cons:**

- Scalability is limited

- Any change requires redeployment of the entire app

- Difficult to adopt new tech stack gradually

**Follow-up:**\
Q: How do you scale a monolith?\
A: Horizontally (cloning) or vertically (resource upgrades), but
fine-grained scaling is difficult.

**✅ 2. What is Microservices Architecture?**

**Answer:**\
Microservices is an architectural style where an application is composed
of small, loosely coupled, independently deployable services, each
responsible for a specific business function.

**Characteristics:**

- Decentralized data management

- Polyglot tech stack

- Independent deployment

- Bounded contexts

**Follow-up:**\
Q: How do microservices communicate?\
A: Mostly via HTTP (REST), gRPC, or asynchronous messaging (Kafka,
RabbitMQ).

**✅ 3. Monolithic vs Microservices Comparison**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Aspect**         **Monolithic**   **Microservices**
  ------------------ ---------------- -------------------------------------
  Deployment         One unit         Multiple independent services

  Scalability        Limited          Fine-grained

  Tech stack         Single           Polyglot

  Fault isolation    Low              High

  Onboarding         Easier           Complex
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

**✅ 4. What is a RESTful API?**

**Answer:**\
RESTful APIs follow the REST architectural style using HTTP methods to
perform CRUD operations on resources represented via URIs.

**Principles:**

- Stateless communication

- Uniform interface

- Resource-based (not actions)

- Representations (JSON, XML)

**Example:**\
GET /users/123 -- Get user with ID 123\
POST /orders -- Create a new order

**Follow-up:**\
Q: How is REST different from SOAP?\
A: REST is lightweight, stateless, uses HTTP. SOAP is heavyweight, uses
XML and strict schemas.

**✅ 5. Explain the 12-Factor App in Microservices.**

**Answer:**\
It\'s a methodology for building cloud-native applications:

1.  Codebase

2.  Dependencies

3.  Config

4.  Backing services

5.  Build, release, run

6.  Processes

7.  Port binding

8.  Concurrency

9.  Disposability

10. Dev/prod parity

11. Logs

12. Admin processes

**✅ 6. What is Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)?**

**Answer:**\
EDA is a design pattern where services communicate through the
production, detection, and reaction to events.

**Components:**

- **Event Producer**: Emits an event

- **Event Channel**: Kafka, RabbitMQ

- **Event Consumer**: Listens and reacts

**Use Cases:**

- Order processing

- IoT systems

- Asynchronous communication

**Follow-up:**\
Q: Why choose EDA over REST?\
A: REST is synchronous and blocking; EDA allows for decoupled,
asynchronous, and scalable communication.

**✅ 7. What are the challenges of Microservices Architecture?**

**Answer:**

- Distributed transactions

- Inter-service communication failures

- Service discovery

- Monitoring & tracing

- Deployment complexity

- Configuration management

**Tools to solve:**

- Circuit Breaker: Resilience4j, Hystrix

- Service Registry: Eureka, Consul

- API Gateway: Zuul, Kong, NGINX

- Tracing: Zipkin, Jaeger

**✅ 8. How do you handle communication in Microservices?**

**Answer:**

- **Synchronous:** REST APIs, gRPC

- **Asynchronous:** Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS

**Pattern:**

- Use async for decoupled workflows

- Use sync where immediate response is needed

**Best Practices:**

- Use retry & fallback mechanisms

- Implement circuit breakers

- Idempotent endpoints for retry handling

**✅ 9. What is a Service Mesh?**

**Answer:**\
A **service mesh** manages service-to-service communication in a
transparent and secure way using a sidecar proxy model.

**Examples:** Istio, Linkerd

**Features:**

- Traffic routing

- Observability

- Security (mTLS)

- Fault tolerance

**✅ 10. How do you manage versioning in REST APIs?**

**Answer:**

- URI versioning: /api/v1/users

- Header-based: Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json

- Query parameters: /users?version=1

**Best Practice:** URI versioning is most widely adopted for simplicity
and clarity.

**✅ 11. How do you ensure data consistency in Microservices?**

**Answer:**

- **Sagas Pattern** for distributed transactions

- **Eventual Consistency** via message queues

- Use **Compensating Transactions** for rollbacks

**Follow-up:**\
Q: How do you implement sagas?\
A: Choreography (event-based) or orchestration (central controller).

**✅ 12. What are Anti-Patterns in Microservices?**

**Answer:**

- Too many microservices (over-fragmentation)

- Shared database among services

- Tight coupling via sync calls

- Not using an API Gateway

- Ignoring observability

Here is a **deeper set of interview questions and answers** tailored for
someone with **12+ years of experience**, focusing on **Microservices
Architecture, RESTful APIs, Monolithic Architecture, and Event-Driven
Architecture (EDA)**---including design trade-offs, cross-cutting
concerns, and real-world patterns.

**🔹 MICROservices Architecture -- Deep Dive**

**✅ Q1: How do you decompose a monolith into microservices?**

**Answer:**\
Decomposition should follow **domain-driven design (DDD)** principles:

- Identify **bounded contexts** (BC) using strategic design.

- Use tools like **Event Storming** or **business capability mapping**.

- Gradually extract functionality behind well-defined APIs.

**Approaches:**

- **Strangler Pattern**: Incrementally route traffic to new services.

- **Vertical slicing** by features (Order, Billing, Inventory).

**Cross Question:**

- Q: How do you ensure consistency when refactoring the database?

- A: Use **change data capture (CDC)**, **dual writes**, or **outbox
  pattern** to sync between old and new systems.

**✅ Q2: How do you handle cross-cutting concerns in microservices?**

**Answer:**\
By using **sidecars or libraries** to abstract common functionality:

- **Logging, Tracing**: OpenTelemetry, Sleuth + Zipkin/Jaeger

- **Security**: OAuth2 via Keycloak, Okta

- **Configuration**: Spring Cloud Config, Consul

- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana

**Best Practice:** Use **Service Mesh** like Istio to offload concerns
such as retries, mTLS, circuit-breaking.

**✅ Q3: What is the role of API Gateway in a microservices system?**

**Answer:**\
Acts as a **reverse proxy** that handles:

- Routing

- Authentication & Rate Limiting

- Caching & Transformation

- Aggregation of service responses

**Examples**: Spring Cloud Gateway, Kong, Zuul, NGINX

**Trade-off:** Adds a single point of failure & requires HA setup.

**Cross-question:**\
Q: How do you handle failures at the gateway?\
A: Retry policy, fallback to cache, use circuit breakers (Resilience4j).

**🔹 RESTful API -- Advanced Concepts**

**✅ Q4: How do you design REST APIs for microservices at scale?**

**Answer:**

- Use **resource-oriented URIs** (not verbs): /orders/123

- Embrace **HATEOAS** for discoverability (optional)

- Design **idempotent operations** (PUT, DELETE)

- Use **correlation IDs** for tracing across services

**Versioning Strategy:**

- URI-based (preferred): /v1/products

- Semantic Versioning

- Graceful deprecation policy

**✅ Q5: How do you secure REST APIs?**

**Answer:**

- Use **OAuth2/OpenID Connect** for delegated auth

- Use **JWTs** with proper expiry & rotation

- Validate scopes and claims

- Enable TLS (HTTPS only)

- CSRF protection (for browser apps)

**Cross-question:**\
Q: How do you validate JWTs in a distributed microservice?\
A: Via introspection endpoint or shared public keys (JWKS URI).

**🔹 Monolithic Architecture -- Advanced**

**✅ Q6: When is Monolithic Architecture better than Microservices?**

**Answer:**

- Small team & fast development cycles

- Less infrastructure overhead

- Low operational complexity

- Tight business domain

**Use Case Examples:**

- MVP or POC

- Apps without scalability or modularity needs

**Cross-question:**\
Q: How do you ensure modularity in a monolith?\
A: Use **modular monolith** via packaging (Maven/Gradle), **hexagonal
architecture**, or **clean architecture**.

**🔹 Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**

**✅ Q7: Compare EDA vs REST in microservice communication.**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Feature**    **REST**                  **Event-Driven**
  -------------- ------------------------- -------------------------------
  Sync/Async     Synchronous               Asynchronous

  Coupling       Tightly coupled           Loosely coupled

  Reliability    Depends on retries        Built-in via message queue

  Examples       GET /orders/123           Event: OrderCreated

  Patterns       API Gateway               Kafka, RabbitMQ
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Best Practice:** Use REST for commands, Events for async state change
propagation.

**✅ Q8: How do you ensure exactly-once event processing?**

**Answer:**

- **Idempotent consumers**

- **Outbox Pattern** with transaction log

- **Kafka with transactional producers + idempotent consumers**

- Use **deduplication store** (Redis/DB)

**Cross-question:**\
Q: What are pitfalls in EDA?\
A:

- Eventual consistency confusion

- Duplicate events

- Unordered processing

- Schema evolution challenges (Protobuf + Schema Registry can help)

**🔹 Design Patterns**

**✅ Q9: Explain common microservices design patterns.**

**Answer:**

- **Service Discovery** -- Eureka, Consul

- **Circuit Breaker** -- Resilience4j, Hystrix

- **Bulkhead** -- Isolate resources per service

- **Saga Pattern** -- For distributed transactions

- **CQRS + Event Sourcing** -- Separate read/write models

- **Sidecar Pattern** -- Proxy for cross-cutting concerns (Envoy)

**✅ Q10: What strategies do you use for data consistency across
microservices?**

**Answer:**

- Use **eventual consistency**

- Implement **SAGA pattern** (Orchestration vs Choreography)

- Use **Outbox + Polling + Kafka** (for reliable publishing)

- Idempotency keys for duplicate event handling

**Follow-up:**\
Q: When do you prefer orchestration over choreography?\
A: Orchestration when you need a central coordinator for complex
workflows (e.g., Order -\> Payment -\> Shipment).

Would you like to include:

- **Case-study based system design Q&A** (e.g., Amazon Orders, Uber
  Booking)?

- **Diagrams (e.g., sequence, architecture)?**

- **Coding challenges for implementing microservice interaction (Spring
  Boot + Kafka)?**

- A downloadable **PDF format**?

**You said:**

More about with code : SAGA pattern (Orchestration vs Choreography)

**ChatGPT said:**

Here's a **deep-dive explanation** of the **SAGA Pattern** with **code
examples** (Spring Boot + Kafka/RestTemplate), covering both
**Orchestration** and **Choreography** styles---suitable for your 12+
years experience level.

**🔹 What is the SAGA Pattern?**

The **Saga Pattern** is a **sequence of local transactions** across
distributed services.\
Each service performs a **local transaction** and publishes an **event**
or invokes the **next step**. If any transaction fails, **compensating
actions** are executed.

**🧭 Two Types of Sagas**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Type**            **Description**
  ------------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  **Choreography**    Services publish and listen to events, no central
                      control.

  **Orchestration**   A central orchestrator directs services and decisions.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔸 1. Choreography-Based Saga**

(Using **Spring Boot + Kafka**)

**✅ Scenario: Order Service → Payment Service → Shipping Service**

**📦 Order Service**

java

CopyEdit

// OrderService.java

\@Service

public class OrderService {

\@Autowired KafkaTemplate\<String, String\> kafkaTemplate;

public void placeOrder(Order order) {

saveOrder(order); // Local DB save

kafkaTemplate.send(\"order-events\", new
ObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(order));

}

}

**📦 Payment Service**

java

CopyEdit

\@KafkaListener(topics = \"order-events\")

public void handleOrder(String message) {

Order order = new ObjectMapper().readValue(message, Order.class);

try {

processPayment(order);

kafkaTemplate.send(\"payment-events\", new
ObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(order));

} catch (Exception e) {

// Log and halt flow, or emit failure event

}

}

**📦 Shipping Service**

java

CopyEdit

\@KafkaListener(topics = \"payment-events\")

public void handlePayment(String message) {

Order order = new ObjectMapper().readValue(message, Order.class);

ship(order);

}

**🔁 Compensation (if payment fails)**

- Payment Service publishes a payment_failed event.

- Order Service listens and marks order as "FAILED".

**Pros:**

- Fully decoupled

- Easy to scale independently

**Cons:**

- Hard to trace complete flow

- Difficult error handling

- Complex debugging

**🔸 2. Orchestration-Based Saga**

(Using **Spring Boot + RestTemplate or WebClient**)

**✅ Central Orchestrator: OrderService**

**OrderService Orchestrator**

java

CopyEdit

\@Service

public class OrderOrchestrator {

public String startOrder(Order order) {

try {

orderRepository.save(order);

paymentClient.processPayment(order); // REST Call

shippingClient.initiateShipping(order); // REST Call

order.setStatus(\"COMPLETED\");

} catch (Exception e) {

// Compensation logic

cancelOrder(order);

}

return \"ORDER_CREATED\";

}

private void cancelOrder(Order order) {

paymentClient.refund(order); // Compensation

order.setStatus(\"FAILED\");

}

}

**REST Clients**

java

CopyEdit

\@Component

public class PaymentClient {

\@Autowired RestTemplate restTemplate;

public void processPayment(Order order) {

restTemplate.postForEntity(\"http://PAYMENT-SVC/pay\", order,
Void.class);

}

public void refund(Order order) {

restTemplate.postForEntity(\"http://PAYMENT-SVC/refund\", order,
Void.class);

}

}

**Compensation (Shipping → Cancel Shipment, Payment → Refund)**

**Pros:**

- Centralized workflow

- Easier monitoring & debugging

- Easier rollback logic

**Cons:**

- Orchestrator becomes tightly coupled

- Less autonomy for services

- May become a bottleneck

**🔍 When to Use What?**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Factor**    **Choreography**          **Orchestration**
  ------------- ------------------------- ---------------------------------
  Simplicity    Good for 2--3 services    Better for complex flows

  Visibility    Harder to trace           Easy to visualize

  Coupling      Loosely coupled           Tightly coupled to orchestrator

  Flexibility   Decentralized decisions   Centralized control
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
