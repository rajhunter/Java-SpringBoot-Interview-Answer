**Core String Interview Questions with Answers**

**1. Why is String immutable in Java? What are the benefits?**

**Answer:**

- String immutability ensures:

  - **Thread safety**: No synchronization needed.

  - **Security**: Used in class loaders, file paths, etc.

  - **Hashcode caching**: Speeds up map lookups.

  - **String pooling**: Saves memory.

  - Prevents data manipulation in sensitive areas (e.g., database URLs).

**Cross-question:**

- *How does immutability affect memory usage in high-throughput
  systems?*

**2. Explain String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer in terms of
performance and thread safety.**

**Answer:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Feature**   **String**             **StringBuilder**   **StringBuffer**
  ------------- ---------------------- ------------------- --------------------
  Mutability    Immutable              Mutable             Mutable

  Thread-Safe   Yes (due to            No                  Yes (synchronized)
                immutability)                              

  Performance   Low (new object on     High                Moderate (sync
                change)                (single-threaded)   overhead)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Cross-question:**

- *How would you design a thread-safe StringBuilder without synchronized
  keyword?*

**3. How does the Java String pool work internally?**

**Answer:**

- JVM maintains a special memory called the **String Constant Pool**.

- String literals are stored here; if a new literal is created, JVM
  checks the pool first.

- String s1 = \"test\"; String s2 = \"test\"; // s1 == s2

**Cross-question:**

- *What happens when we use new String(\"test\") instead of a literal?*

**4. What are the performance implications of + operator in loops for
String concatenation?**

**Answer:**

- \+ creates a new StringBuilder each time.

- Leads to many temporary objects â†’ **heap pressure & GC overhead**.

- Use StringBuilder/StringBuffer for performance.

**Cross-question:**

- *How would you optimize string concatenation of 1000 strings?*

**5. What happens internally when you call s.concat(\"world\") on String
s = \"Hello\"?**

**Answer:**

- A new String object is created; s remains unchanged.

- concat() does: return new
  StringBuilder(this).append(\"world\").toString();

**6. Can you override equals() and hashCode() for String class? Why or
why not?**

**Answer:**

- No, because String is a final class.

- Its equals() checks value equality; hashCode() is overridden to
  reflect character content.

**7. How does intern() method work? When would you use it?**

**Answer:**

- intern() places a string in the **string pool** if not already
  present.

- Use it to save memory when many strings have the same value.

java

CopyEdit

String a = new String(\"test\").intern();

**Cross-question:**

- *What are the downsides of excessive use of intern()?*

**8. What is the difference between == and .equals() with Strings?**

**Answer:**

- == checks **reference equality**.

- .equals() checks **value/content equality**.

**Cross-question:**

- *Can you give a real-time bug example caused by using == with
  Strings?*

**9. Is String thread-safe? Why?**

**Answer:**

- Yes, because it is **immutable**.

- Shared access doesn't risk modification.

**10. What is the output of the following snippet?**

java

CopyEdit

String a = \"Hello\";

String b = new String(\"Hello\");

System.out.println(a == b); // ?

System.out.println(a.equals(b)); // ?

**Answer:**

- a == b â†’ false (different references)

- a.equals(b) â†’ true (same value)

**ðŸ”· Advanced String Questions**

**11. What is the memory structure of String in Java (Heap, Pool,
PermGen/MetaSpace)?**

**Answer:**

- String literals go to **String Constant Pool** (stored in heap since
  Java 7).

- Interned Strings go to the pool.

- new String() objects are stored in **heap memory**.

**12. Explain String deduplication in Java 8+.**

**Answer:**

- JVM option: -XX:+UseStringDeduplication

- Enables GC to detect duplicate character arrays and point them to a
  single char\[\].

- Useful in high-duplicate environments (e.g., large logs, XML parsing).

**13. How does StringJoiner work internally? When would you use it?**

**Answer:**

- Introduced in Java 8.

- More efficient alternative for joining delimited strings.

- Internally uses StringBuilder.

**14. What is the difference between String.split() and using
Pattern.split()?**

**Answer:**

- String.split() uses regex under the hood â†’ slower for large-scale.

- Pattern.split() reuses the compiled pattern â†’ **faster for repeated
  use**.

**Example:**

java

CopyEdit

Pattern p = Pattern.compile(\",\");

p.split(\"a,b,c\");

**15. How can you reverse a String in Java efficiently?**

**Answer:** java

CopyEdit

String input = \"Hello\";

String reversed = new StringBuilder(input).reverse().toString();

**ðŸ”· Design/Real-world Questions**

**16. How would you implement a custom ImmutableString class?**

**Answer:**

- Final class.

- Final internal char array.

- Deep copy on construction and on getter.

- No mutating methods.

**17. How would you store millions of repeating strings efficiently in
memory?**

**Answer:**

- Use:

  - **intern()**

  - **String deduplication**

  - **Custom canonicalization using Map\<String, String\>**

**18. How do internationalization (Unicode, encoding) issues affect
String operations?**

**Answer:**

- Java String is UTF-16 encoded.

- Length â‰  number of characters (because of surrogate pairs).

- charAt() can mislead in multibyte characters.

**19. What is the difference between substring() in Java 6 vs Java 7+?**

**Answer:**

- Java 6: substring() shares the original char\[\] â†’ **memory leak
  risk**.

- Java 7+: substring() creates new char\[\].

**20. What is the behavior of String.valueOf(null)?**

**Answer:**

- Returns \"null\" (string literal), doesn't throw NullPointerException.
